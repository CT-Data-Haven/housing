# Housing segregation in Greater New Haven, yesterday and today

*See this in action at https://ct-data-haven.github.io/housing*

## Intro

The New Haven metro area is among the most racially and economically segregated
in the US. We can trace this segregation at least as far back as the New Deal
policies of the 1930s, when federal agencies such as the Home Owners' Loan
Corporation (HOLC) used
[redlining](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redlining.asp)--the denial of
home loans in predominantly Black neighborhoods--to decide where to help
families buy homes and where to refuse to invest. HOLC produced maps of the
"safety" of investment in neighborhoods throughout the country, including many
in and around New Haven. Neighborhoods were given grades from a rubric of
factors like the primary type of workers, what share of the neighborhood was
foreign-born, what ethnicities were "infiltrating," and whether or not there was
a "Negro" population.

While a map made 80 years ago might seem outdated, the majority of New Haven's
housing was built before 1939, and these are therefore the very same houses for
which loans were being granted or denied. In this data story, we investigate
data on the patterns of housing segregation that still exist here today.

## Redlining in New Haven

In 1937, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) mapped ratings of
how "safe" it was to invest in homeownership in neighborhoods
covering most of New Haven and parts of surrounding towns. Ratings
went from A, "Best," to D, "Hazardous," based on the demographics
and economic well-being of residents in each neighborhood.

## Same neighborhoods, 80 years later

Today's neighborhoods are easily identifiable on this 80-year-old
map: lower ratings were given to areas that are still home to Black
and immigrant communities, and high ratings--and with them,
mortgages--were given to areas that are still affluent and mostly
white.

## Our towns are still segregated today

New Haven is a racially diverse city, but the surrounding towns, aside from
Hamden and West Haven, are nearly 90 percent white. Hamden and West Haven stand
out from the other suburbs by being more diverse than the more affluent suburbs
and having more opportunities for lower- and middle-income families to buy
houses.

## Homeownership is still connected to grade

Homeownership remains elusive in redlined areas. Today, homeownership is more
than twice as high in grade A blocks than in the grade D blocks that were seen
as unfit for investment generations ago.

## You can't buy houses where they don't exist

One issue here is the housing stock. Only a quarter of New Haven's housing units
are single-family houses, whereas single-family housing is the norm in the
suburbs. Most of the suburbs have zoning laws that restrict or forbid building
multi-family housing, keeping out families that need to rent.

## Few city residents own their homes

It's typical for homeownership to be lower in cities than in surrounding
suburbs. Homeownership is nearly 3 times as high in the suburbs, excluding
Hamden and West Haven, as it is in the city.

## But it's not just about location

Regardless of where they live, Black and Latino families have much lower
homeownership rates. Even in suburbs with high homeownership rates, Black and
Latino families are much less likely to own than their white neighbors.

## Segregation in where we live and what we own

Generations after grade A neighborhoods were marked for investment, the
beneficiaries of this investment are still almost all white. White people make
up 88 percent of the homeowners in grade A neighborhoods today. And while
homeownership is low in grade C and D areas, white residents of those areas make
up disproportionately large shares of the owners.

## White residents are isolated within the region

Another way to measure segregation is how isolated groups are from one another.
Nearly three-quarters of the white residents of Greater New Haven live in a
neighborhood that is at least 75 percent the same race as them. Only 7 percent
of Black residents live in such an isolated area, and no areas are so
overwhelmingly Latino.

## Some good news

As isolated as we are, this is actually an improvement: in 1980, nearly 90
percent of white residents and over a quarter of Black ones lived in
racially-isolated neighborhoods.

We have a long way to go towards integrating our area. But while our segregated
landscape today looks bad, it's at least less bad than a few decades ago.
