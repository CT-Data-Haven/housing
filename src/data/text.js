            ## Redlining in New Haven

            In 1937, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) mapped ratings of how "safe" it was to invest in homeownership in neighborhoods covering most of New Haven and West Haven, and parts of Hamden and other surrounding towns. Ratings went from A, "Best," to D, "Hazardous," based on the demographics and economic well-being of residents in each neighborhood.

            ## Redlining in New Haven today

            Even though the HOLC map was made 80 years ago, today's neighborhoods are easily identifiable: lower ratings were given to areas that are still home to Black and immigrant communities, and high ratings--and with them, mortgages--were given to areas that are still affluent and mostly white.

            ## Our towns are still segregated today

            New Haven's population is nearly evenly split by race. The surrounding towns, aside from Hamden and West Haven, are nearly 90 percent white. Hamden and West Haven stand out from the other suburbs: they are much more diverse than the more affluent suburbs, they are places where homeownership is more accessible to lower- and middle-income families, and they were both documented by HOLC.

            ## Our neighborhoods are segregated as well

            These patterns of segregation persist at a neighborhood level also. Some of the very same communities that were once off-limits for homeownership, such as Fair Haven and Dixwell, are still almost all people of color, while areas that HOLC marked as suitable for investment include mostly white, affluent neighborhoods like East Shore and Westville.

            ## Homeownership is still connected to grade

            Homeownership remains elusive in redlined areas. Today, homeownership is more than twice as high in grade A blocks than in the grade D blocks that were seen as unfit for investment generations ago.

			## You can't buy houses where they don't exist

One issue here is the housing stock. Only a quarter of New Haven's housing units are single-family houses, whereas single-family housing is the norm in the suburbs. Most of the suburbs have zoning laws that restrict or forbid building multi-family housing, making these towns inaccessible for families that need to rent.

			## A housing stock catch-22

Single-family houses are virtually nonexistant in some New Haven neighborhoods, as well, particularly in neighborhoods like West River, Dixwell, and Fair Haven that were once given a grade D. Some of the neighborhoods that were marked for investment by HOLC even have zoning restrictions that limit multi-family housing.

We're stuck with a housing catch-22: for the most part, the areas with more single-family houses, such as the suburbs or more affluent neighborhoods, have higher housing values. A lower- to middle-income family might find that the houses that exist are in places they can't afford, and the places they can afford don't have houses to buy.

            ## Few city residents own their homes

Through the combination of many demographic and socioeconomic factors, as well as housing stock, it's typical for homeownership to be lower in cities than in surrounding suburbs. Homeownership is nearly 3 times as high in the suburbs, excluding Hamden and West Haven, as it is in the city.

            ## But it's not just about location

Regardless of where they live, Black and Latino families have much lower homeownership rates. White city residents are much more likely to own some of the limited single-family housing. Even in suburbs with high homeownership rates, Black and Latino families are much less likely to own than their white neighbors.

            ## Segregated burdens of disinvestment

Generations after grade A neighborhoods--free of ethnic "infiltration" and noted as home to professors and white collar workers--were marked for investment, the beneficiaries of this investment are still almost all white. White people make up 88 percent of the homeowners in grade A neighborhoods today. And while homeownership is low in grade C and D areas, white residents of those areas make up disproportionately large shares of the owners. Segregation today is not just where we live, but what we own.

            ## White residents are isolated within the region

            Another way to measure segregation is how isolated groups are from one another. Nearly three-quarters of the white residents of Greater New Haven live in a census tract (generally comparable to a neighborhood) that is at least 75 percent the same race as them. Only 7 percent of Black residents live in such an isolated tract--the 4,800 residents of Newhallville--and no tracts are so overwhelmingly Latino.

            ## Some good news

            As isolated as we are, this is actually an improvement: in 1980, nearly 90 percent of white residents and over a quarter of Black ones lived in racially-isolated tracts.

            We have a long way to go towards integrating our area. But while our segregated landscape today looks bad, it's at least less bad than a few decades ago.
