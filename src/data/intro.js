The New Haven metro area is among the most racially and economically segregated in the US. We can trace this segregation at least as far back as the New Deal policies of the 1930s, when federal agencies such as the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) used [redlining](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redlining.asp)--the denial of home loans in predominantly Black neighborhoods--to decide where to help families buy homes and where to refuse to invest. HOLC produced maps of the "safety" of investment in neighborhoods throughout the country, including many in and around New Haven. Neighborhoods were given grades from a rubric of factors like the primary type of workers, what share of the neighborhood was foreign-born, what ethnicities were "infiltrating," and whether or not there was a "Negro" population.

While a map made 80 years ago might seem outdated, the majority of New Haven's housing was built before 1939, and these are therefore the very same houses for which loans were being granted or denied. In this data story, we investigate data on the patterns of housing segregation that still exist here today.
